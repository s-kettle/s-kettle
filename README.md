### Hi there 👋 I'm **Sam**!

- 💻 I'm a **software developer** at **CMSG Ltd**, where I work on **React**, a leading ASB (Anti-Social Behaviour) case management system, and its partner **ASB App**.
- 🔧 My **tech stack** includes **C#**, **.NET**, **Blazor**, and **JavaScript**, though I’ve also got experience with **Java**, **Spring**, and **Android** development.
- 📚 **Book lover**. I'll be buried in a good novel when I’m not coding.
- 🎶 **Music enthusiast**. I love all types of music, especially electronic, metal, and jazz. I produce on Logic Pro when I have a spare minute (not often!)
- 🚴 **Cyclist** when I need to get away from the desk.
- 🏒 **Ice-hockey enthusiast**. Let's go Nottingham Panthers!  

### What I'm working on:
- **Blazor Client Tracking App** – A personal project to manage client data efficiently using the Blazor framework.
- **Personal Website** – featuring a blog and project list.
