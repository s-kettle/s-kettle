### Hi there 👋 I'm **Sam**!

- 💻 I'm a **software developer** at CMSG Ltd. I work on React, a leading ASB (Anti-Social Behaviour) case management system, and the partner ASB App.
- 🔧 Tech stack => C#, .NET, Blazor, and JavaScript. I also have experience with Java, Spring, and Android.
- 📚 **Book lover**. I'll be buried in a good novel when I’m not coding.
- 🎶 **Music enthusiast**. I love all types of music, especially electronic, metal, and jazz. I produce on Logic Pro when I have a spare minute (not often!)
- 🚴 **Cyclist** when I need to get away from the desk.
- 🏒 **Ice-hockey enthusiast**. Let's go Nottingham Panthers!  

### What I'm working on:
